abstract: |-
  Speech is being used increasingly to create
  documents. This is due to the availability of high-quality
  speech recognition software along with devices that capture
  speech signal ubiquitously. This has helped people to make best
  use of their time while performing non-productive activities
  such as commuting to & from work. Many solutions exist to
  convert dictations to text documents. However, there are very
  few solutions which can display a visual depiction of a spoken
  equation.
  In this paper, the authors propose a system that can take an
  audio signal containing an equation and convert it to its visual
  depiction. The authors make use of available 3rd party speech
  recognition system along with a proposed system for part of
  equation (PoE) tagging. The tokens and the PoE tags are used
  along with a set of pre-defined rules to create the equation
  sting used for emulation and display of the mathematical
  equation.
