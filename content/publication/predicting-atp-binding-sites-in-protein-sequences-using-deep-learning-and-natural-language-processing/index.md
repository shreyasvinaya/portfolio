  Predicting ATP-Protein Binding sites in genes is of great significance in the
  field of Biology and Medicine. The majority of research in this field has been
  conducted through time and resource intensive ’wet experiments’ in
  laboratories. Since a few years, researchers have been investigating
  computational methods computational methods to accomplish the same goals,
  utilising the strength of advanced Deep Learning and NLP algorithms. In this
  paper, we propose to develop methods to classify ATP Protein binding sites. We
  conducted various experiments mainly using PSSMs and several word embeddings
  as features. We used 2D CNNs and LightGBM classifiers as our chief Deep
  Learning Algorithms. The MP3Vec and BERT models have also been subjected to
  test- ing in our study. The outcomes of our experiments demonstrated
  incremental improvement over the state-of-the-art benchmarks.
